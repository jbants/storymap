            <section data-place="overview">
                <p>Ghost River Watershed is situated west of the City of Calgary, and just east of Banff National Park. The Ghost River originates at the headwaters of the Rocky Mountains near Mount Oliver and flows generally eastward where it meets up with the South Ghost River and further downstream Waiparous Creek. It then discharges into the Bow River upstream of the Ghost dam, creating the Ghost reservoir. Considered by many as “Calgary’s playground”, the Ghost Watershed is 947 km2 in size and hosts a multitude of world-class recreational trails. Approximately 86% of the Ghost watershed is considered public lands, including portions of the Rocky Mountain Forest Reserve, Don Getty Wildland Provincial Park, and the Ghost River Wilderness Area. Visitors can enjoy camping, hiking, climbing and ice climbing, hunting, fishing, horseback riding, and OHV use. Generally, the biodiversity of the watershed is quite rich with a variety of wildlife, fish, and plant populations. However, it is not invulnerable to impact; proper land management is necessary to keep encroaching human impacts at bay and maintain the ecological integrity of the entire Ghost River Watershed.</p>
                <p>Cumulative human presence in the Ghost from recreation and anthropogenic land use is placing increasing stress on the watershed. Proper management and planning for sustainable development is the goal for all stakeholders within the basin, including municipalities, provincial governments, First Nations groups, industry, and private citizens, and non-governmental organizations.
                The Ghost Watershed Alliance Society (GWAS) plays an integral role in managing the Ghost River Watershed to “preserve and enhance the integrity of the ecosystem” (GWAS, 2015). Established in 2002, the GWAS aims to develop a science-based understanding of the watershed. As such, the GWAS has contracted several scientific reports concerning cumulative effects, water quality, riparian health, and, as contained in this report, the State of the Watershed (SOW).</p>
                <p>The purpose of a SOW report is to provide up-to-date information on the “current condition in a descriptive inventory of the existing natural resources and human activities within a watershed” (GWAS, 2015). More specifically, the Ghost River SOW report is to act as an objective tool that uses available data to assess the condition of the Ghost Watershed, and to identify any present concerns and any factors that are contributing to these areas of concern. This SOW report should act as a first component to a watershed management plan for the Ghost River Watershed.</p>
                <p>The remainder of this report depicts the current state of the Ghost River Watershed, in terms of socio-economic history and condition; surface water quantity and allocation; surface water quality; groundwater; riparian and wetland health; biodiversity and wildlife resources; air quality; land use and development; and existing plans, programs, and watershed stewardship. Each topic will be addressed in its own chapter</p>

            <section data-place="ghost">
                <h2>Ghost</h2>
                <p>The Ghost Watershed comprises the portion of the east slope of the Rocky Mountains of Alberta that is drained by the Ghost River. The main stem North Ghost River drains the northwestern portion of the basin, beginning near Mt. Oliver in the Ghost River Wilderness Area. The South Ghost River drains the southern portion of the basin, joining with the main stem Ghost River near the Alberta Forest Reserve border. Another major tributary, Waiparous Creek, drains the Northeastern portion of the basin and discharges into the Ghost River in the Summer Village of Waiparous.</p>
                <p>Water from the Rocky Mountains flows generally eastward from the high Alpine zone down through forested slopes and lower foothills. From there, the water moves out onto more gentle grassy valleys, via a deeply incised lower canyon, until the Ghost River's confluence with the Bow River at the Ghost Reservoir, the lower boundary of the Ghost Watershed. Water from the Ghost Watershed eventually makes its way downslope to the Bow River, and then flows into the South Saskatchewan River and on to Lake Winnipeg and, ultimately, Hudson Bay. Water in this larger river system provides drinking water to several downstream communities, including over 1 million Albertans who live in the City of Calgary.</p>
                <p>This topographic gradient, running roughly west to east, largely determines the physical and biological characteristics of the Ghost Watershed. The gradual eastward decrease in elevation and slope underlie changes in geology, soils, climate, vegetation, and human use, all of which also change predictably from west to east.</p>
                <p>Most of the Ghost Watershed falls in the Rocky Mountain Natural Region, which encompasses Alpine, Subalpine, and Montane subregions. Almost all of the remainder is part of the Foothills Natural Region, and only a small corner of the watershed belongs to the Parkland Natural Region. The Alpine subregion is largely above treeline, and vegetation is dominated by cushion plants and small shrubs, with occasional dwarf trees in protected sites. The Subalpine subregion features forests of spruce, fir, and pine, while the Montane subregion is dominated by forests of mixed conifers, aspen, and balsam poplar. Vegetation cover in the Foothills region largely consists of lodgepole pine or mixedwood forests, with black spruce in wetter soils and some grassland on south and west-facing exposures.</p>
                <p>The majority of the Ghost Watershed, including the Rocky Mountains Forest Reserve, Don Getty Wildland Provincial Park and the Ghost River Wilderness Area, lies within the Green Area of the province of Alberta, and is thus under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. Some local services within the Green Area are provided by Municipal District of Bighorn No. 8, such as emergency response. The MD administers much of the White Area of the basin, including the communities of Ghost Country and the Hamlet of Benchlands. The Summer Village of Waiparous has its own administration as an incorporated village. About 8% of the basin is administered by the Stoney First Nation under the authority of Treaty Seven.</p>

            <section data-place="socio_economic">
                <h2>Socio-Economic History &amp Condition</h2>
                <p>People have lived in the Ghost Watershed for hundreds and probably thousands of years, although even the present First Nations inhabitants, the Stoney Nation, are relative newcomers to the area, having arrived around 1640. Today, the watershed is sparsely inhabited with only two higher-density developments--the community of Benchlands and the Summer Village of Waiparous, and further residential development is highly restricted.</p>
                <p>Important land uses within the Ghost Watershed include forestry, ranching, and recreation. The watershed is also affected by a major hydropower diversion (inactive as of 2016) to Lake Minnewanka, which can alter stream flows.</p>
                <p>In recent years, residents and other users of the Ghost Watershed have expressed serious concerns about unregulated recreational use of the region, which is leading to ecosystem degradation, vandalism, and increased risk to road users.</p>

            <section  data-place="surface_water_quantity">
                <h2>Surface Water Quantity and Allocation</h2>
                <p>Streamflow in the Ghost River is dominated by snowmelt. Streamflow in rivers and creeks within the watershed is low in winter when most water is stored as snow, particularly at higher elevations, and peaks in late spring as snowmelt runs off. Much of the snowmelt recharges groundwater in aquifers, which then plays a substantial role in feeding flow in streams and rivers throughout the late summer, fall, and winter, when inputs to the system in the form of rain or snow are relatively low.</p>
                <p>Annual streamflow volumes vary greatly from year to year, depending primarily on the depth of the snowpack and secondarily on rainfall during the warmer months. This variation is most dramatic in spring and summer, when flows during a wet year can be several times larger than flows during dry years. On average, the Ghost River and its tributaries produce an annual volume of nearly 200 million cubic metres of water, which accounts for about 7% of the water flowing into the Ghost Reservoir.</p>
                <p>Surface water within the Ghost Watershed is not highly allocated to human uses today, as compared to rivers in more heavily populated regions. The biggest commitment of water is a diversion of 43.2 million cubic metres per year to Lake Minnewanka for hydroelectric power generation. This volume is equal to approximately 63% of the water in the upper Ghost River, and 22% of the streamflow volume in the watershed as a whole. The diversion is not presently taking place due to damage from the floods of 2013, but the power company, TransAlta, plans to seek regulatory approval to rebuild the diversion. The diversion to Lake Minnewanka constitutes more than 99% of all water allocations from the Ghost Watershed. Other allocations include agricultural and municipal licences and registrations and household rights for residents.</p>
            </section>

            <section  data-place="surface_water_quality">
                <h2>Surface Water Quality</h2>
                <p>Water quality is an important indicator of the health of a watershed. As changes in the Ghost Watershed occur, water quality will need to be monitored to help protect the ecological integrity of the aquatic systems.</p>
                <p>Water Quality Index ratings for sampling sites within the Ghost Watershed all rate Excellent or Good, except the Ghost river between 1990-1999, and the Ghost River at Benchlands between 2008-2014 which rated Marginal and Fair, respectively. These ratings are based on the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) water quality index methodology (CCME, 2011).</p>
                <p>Water quality in the Ghost Watershed is generally healthy today, with an overall rating for all indicators as “Good”, as categorized by the Bow River Basin 2010 State of the Watershed (SOW) report, indicating that less than 10% of recorded measurements fail to meet water quality objectives. These water quality objectives, or thresholds of concern, are primarily defined by the Environmental Quality Guidelines for Alberta Surface Waters (Table 5.1). In particular, levels of nitrate and inorganic solids are at an order of magnitude below thresholds of concern. pH levels are also within the “Natural” range, and while a few samples show some deviations from normal levels, the overall rating for the watershed was still “Good”.</p>
                <p>However, several water quality indicators appear to be degraded from their natural levels within the Ghost Watershed. In particular, long-term water clarity is rated only “Fair” at several sites, most notably at Waiparous Creek, the middle reaches of the Ghost River, and Benchlands. Short-term decreases in water clarity are also an on-going problem along the Ghost River (upstream of South Ghost and at Richards Road; Figure 5.2); however, continual data collection is important and would help in understanding temporal trends. For example, only 3.7% of samples exceeded thresholds of concern in recent samples for turbidity as compared with 10% a decade ago. It is important to understand if this is a trend towards better water quality or simply variation in the dataset. Fecal coliform and E.coli levels also exceed thresholds of concern within the lower reaches of the watershed, specifically at Benchlands. Fecal coliform levels exceeded safe thresholds, as defined by the provincial water quality guidelines for the protection of agricultural water uses, in almost one out of every four measurements, suggesting that the problem is persistent at this site and most likely requires further attention.</p>
                <p>Dissolved oxygen levels appear adequate for most species, including spring mayflies, but are considered too low for larval fish in all sample periods in Waiparous Creek, and in two of the three sample periods in the middle Ghost River (over 10% exceedance of thresholds; see Figure 5.4). This suggests there may be a long-term issue for larval fish habitat in these specific locations in the Ghost Watershed. However, these general water quality ratings may not accurately reflect habitat quality, since fish habitat is highly variable from place to place. Further monitoring may be valuable in these sub-basins and along specific reaches where larval fish habitat is present.</p>
            </section>

            <section data-place="groundwater">
                <h2>Groundwater</h2>
                <p>Groundwater quantity and quality are important indicators of watershed health, given that it is this water that provides a source of drinking water and supports a wide range of ecosystems. As human population growth increases and water use inevitably increases as well, groundwater quality and use will need to be adequately managed.</p>
                <p>Groundwater use is considered low in the Ghost Watershed; groundwater allocations (excluding household wells) represent only 0.04% of total water licences in the watershed and amount to approximately 57 000 m3/year. Furthermore, these allocations pertaining to groundwater wells are located in areas of the basin that provide sufficient groundwater yield. From this we can assume that groundwater use in the basin is sustainable.</p>
                <p>A groundwater quality vulnerability assessment, which considers travel times of potential pollutants, concludes that parts of the watershed are highly vulnerable. These vulnerable areas are located in the valley bottom and in the headwaters of the Ghost. Fortunately, this is a region with relatively little groundwater well development. The majority of groundwater wells are located on portions of the watershed in areas that are less vulnerable, with the exception of those located in the valley bottom. Groundwater quality samples from these wells was historically good, with only one (fluoride) sample out of 83 measured exceeding maximum allowable concentrations when analyzed for Nitrate, Nitrite, fluoride, and pH, all of which are naturally occurring groundwater components. Collecting more up-to-date data, such as mineral concentrations, would enable this analysis to be more current and robust, and should be focused on wells located in the valley bottom given that this is an area of high vulnerability.</p>
            </section>

            <section  data-place="riperian">
                <h2>Riperian and Wetland Health</h2>
                <p>Riparian areas-the vegetated zones that border lakes, streams, and rivers-are a crucial player in any watershed, because they form an ecosystem that is essential for both aquatic and terrestrial species, including invertebrates, fish, and wildlife populations. Properly functioning riparian areas also filter runoff from rain and snowmelt, stabilize banks to reduce erosion, store and release water, and maintain the integrity of fish habitat. In short, a healthy watershed needs healthy riparian areas.</p>
                <p>Wetlands are low-lying areas that are inundated with water, supporting a range of aquatic plant species and wildlife. Wetlands play an important role in watershed function by filtering water, slowing down runoff, and promoting biodiversity. The area occupied by wetlands is relatively sparse in mountain-foothill environments like the Ghost Watershed. Therefore, these areas are considered to be highly valuable.</p>
                <p>The most recent assessments of riparian health in the Ghost Watershed took place during 2010 for Waiparous Creek and 2011 for the rest of the watershed. Neither survey sampled high-elevation headwaters streams, which are presumed to be in healthy condition because they experience little human impact. The remainder of the Waiparous Creek sub-watershed is in generally good health, with a few areas of moderate degradation, particularly on Johnson and Meadow Creeks, and largely as a result of off-road vehicle activity.</p>
                <p>The mainstem Ghost River and its other tributaries are also generally healthy. However, the area immediately downstream of the Lake Minnewanka diversion was rated unhealthy because of extremely low riparian cover. Less severe problems occur at one site on Baymer Creek where livestock grazing may be contributing to an excess of invasive and disturbance-associated plants, and near the confluence with the Ghost Reservoir, where the channel has shifted, leading to bank instability and an increase in invasive plants. Wetlands near the Ghost River also rated healthy but with problems due to the widespread distribution of invasive plants and exposed and compacted soil from trail usage.</p>
            </section>

            <section  data-place="biodiversity">
                <h2>Biodiversity &amp Wildlife Resources</h2>
                <p>The Ghost River Watershed overlaps multiple Natural Regions of Alberta, with its headwaters originating in the Rocky Mountains Natural Region and flowing through the Foothills Natural Region. The Ghost Watershed’s Natural Sub-regions, including the alpine, subalpine, montane, upper and lower foothills, and foothills parkland sub-region provide the landscape with a complexity that supports biodiversity (Alberta Tourism Parks and Recreation, 2006).</p>
                <p>Generally, the biota in the watershed is rich and diverse, with a variety of wildlife, fish, and plant populations. Species at risk indicators appear to be fairly healthy; however, declining trends in certain population are expected for the future. Westslope cutthroat trout have been found in genetically pure populations throughout the watershed, with only a few hybrid populations documented – this is encouraging, but the threat from invasive hybridization remains and proper management is imperative. Bull trout, on the other hand, are considered at high risk within the Ghost Watershed and recovery potential is low. This could be due to the dominance of invasive fish species (i.e. Brook trout) in the watershed. Two rare and endangered plant species, Mountain mare’s tail and Limber pine, have both been documented within the Ghost Watershed, which may be an indication of a healthy ecosystem that can support such rare endangered species. Invertebrate communities in the Ghost Watershed indicate a healthy aquatic ecosystem with a high presence of pollution intolerant species. Grizzly bear, a keystone indicator-species, have been documented at multiple locations within the basin despite moderate human presence. The presence of Grizzly bear is often indicative of a healthy ecosystem containing large patches of undisturbed habitat, therefore it is important to maintain their populations in face of increasing human presence and habitat fragmentation.</p>
                <p>Pressure from disturbance indicators, such as habitat fragmentation and spread of invasive species, is generally rated as low in the Ghost Watershed. Remaining patches of native vegetation coverage is also high at 85%, indicating that the Ghost Watershed is under low pressure from areal disturbances. Despite these promising indications of good ecological health, road densities, specifically, approach levels at which Grizzly bears will be significantly displaced and Bull trout populations are at high risk. Furthermore, invasive plant species seem to be widespread in the riparian zones, as documented by Cows and Fish (2011;2012).</p>
                <p>Critical habitat indicators are in moderate condition and show no indication of significant change since the 1900s. According to ALCES simulations net change in forest age structure since the 1900s has shown a 3-year increase. This indicates a stable forest habitat; however, cumulative impact analyses project forest age to shift to a younger structure in the Ghost Watershed in the coming years (ALCES Landscape and Land use, 2012). Native grasslands, although quite minimal in the Ghost, encompassing only 7.6% of the area, are stable when considering their net change since the 1900s.</p>
                <p>Overall, the Ghost Watershed is able to support and provide a niche for certain species-at-risk and keystone species. Pressure from disturbance indicators are generally rated as low, and critical habitat has been stable for the past few decades. Combined, these indicators conclude that biodiversity is strong in the Ghost, but not invulnerable to impact. Proper land management is necessary to keep disturbances low, ensure stability of critical habitat, and maintain a diverse array of species.</p>
            </section>

            <section  data-place="air_quality">
                <h2>Air Quality</h2>
                <p>Few measurements exist of air pollution within the Ghost River Watershed. However, the evidence that is available suggests that air quality is generally excellent. Measurements of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and ozone in the Ghost Watershed are all well below thresholds set by Alberta's Ambient Air Quality Objectives. Levels of emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide have not been measured within the Ghost Watershed. Levels of these pollutants in the city of Calgary generally meet air quality standards, which suggests that the Ghost Watershed--with less urbanization and fewer sources of emissions--should meet these standards easily as well. The lack of air quality data in the Ghost Watershed poses an issue if meaningful air quality analysis and accurate air quality monitoring is desired. It is recommended to install a continuous monitoring station within the Ghost Watershed to rectify this issue.</p>
            </section>

            <section  data-place="landuse">
                <h2>Land Use and Development</h2>
                <p>Large portions of the upper reaches of the Ghost Watershed are protected from development and OHV use within the Ghost River Wilderness and Don Getty Wildland Provincial Park. Outside of these protected areas, the land use history of the Ghost Watershed has been one of increasing access and human impact, particularly by recreational users. In particular, a high density of roads and trails immediately adjacent to streams poses a risk to riparian and aquatic habitats. Both residents and visitors express concern over the growing use of the area by off-highway vehicles (OHVs) and associated random camping.</p>
                <p>Other significant land uses in the watershed include livestock grazing, oil and gas extraction, and hunting and fishing. A small amount of crop agriculture and a few gravel pits occur, mostly in the lowland eastern portions of the watershed. Forestry also occurs within the watershed, though the area affected is relatively small and no new clearcuts are planned until at least 2020. As a result, the main impact from forestry is likely to result from recreational access along forestry roads, although these roads are being managed to reduce this access.</p>
                <p>Little residential development has occurred within the Ghost Watershed, and any future development will be restricted to the vicinity of the two existing settlements, the hamlet of Benchlands and the Summer Village of Waiparous.</p>
